# 📶 TRAI Network QoS Sensor using ESP32

This project presents a **real-time Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring sensor** built using the **ESP32 DevKit V1**. It is designed to analyze mobile network quality indicators like **RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)** and **ping latency** to a public server such as Google.com. The sensor broadcasts this data over a **local Wi-Fi network**, allowing users to access a live dashboard through a web browser without needing internet connectivity.

This project was built for academic research under the **Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI)** to demonstrate a **low-cost, simulation-based network QoS monitoring system** suitable for drive tests and performance evaluations.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a **portable, low-cost, real-time network QoS sensor** using ESP32 that:
- Measures and displays **Wi-Fi signal strength** and **internet latency**
- Hosts a **local HTML dashboard**
- Requires minimal hardware
- Can be extended with live MQTT streaming, data logging, or even cloud sync

---

## 🛠️ Features

- 📡 Measures **RSSI** in dBm
- ⏱️ Calculates **ping latency** to external servers
- 🌐 Hosts a **local web dashboard** with auto-refresh
- 🧠 Extremely **lightweight**, runs on bare ESP32
- 🔌 Works offline after local Wi-Fi connection
- 🎓 Ideal for **academic demo, research papers**, or **drive test field deployments**

## 📊 System Architecture

ESP32 ↔ Wi-Fi ↔ Internet
      ↓
   Local Web Server
      ↓
User Browser → Dashboard (HTML)

## 🖥 How It Works

- 🟢 **ESP32 boots up and hosts its own Wi-Fi network** (SSID: `antivirus`)
- 📱 **User connects to this Wi-Fi** from any nearby phone or laptop
- 📶 ESP32 measures:
  - **RSSI** using `WiFi.RSSI()` to evaluate signal strength
  - **Ping latency** using `WiFiClient.connect("google.com", 80)`
- 🌐 ESP32 runs a **local web server** that serves a real-time **HTML dashboard**
- 🌍 **Browser connects to ESP32's IP address** (automatically shown in Serial Monitor)
- 🔁 **Data auto-refreshes every 5 seconds**, allowing continuous monitoring

---

## 🧪 Future Improvements

- 📤 **Push live data to MQTT brokers or cloud dashboards** for centralized monitoring
- 📉 Add **real-time graphing** using tools like **Plotly.js** or **Python Dash**
- 🗂 Store data locally using **microSD card** or **SPIFFS**
- 🌐 Expand for **mobile-tethered networks** to support 4G/5G drive testing
- 📱 Develop a **responsive mobile dashboard** for smartphones
- 🛰 Integrate **GPS module** for location-tagged QoS measurements
